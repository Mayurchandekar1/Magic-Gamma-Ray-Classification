# Magic-Gamma-Ray-Classification
This project focuses on classifying gamma-ray and hadron events from a MAGIC telescope dataset using various machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, standardized, and classified using algorithms like:<br>

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) <br>
Naive Bayes <br>
Logistic Regression <br>
Support Vector Machines (SVM) <br>
Deep Learning with TensorFlow <br>
