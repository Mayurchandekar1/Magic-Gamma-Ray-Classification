# Magic-Gamma-Ray-Classification
This project focuses on classifying gamma-ray and hadron events from a MAGIC telescope dataset using various machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, standardized, and classified using algorithms like: 
##### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
##### Naive Bayes 
##### Logistic Regression 
##### Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
##### Deep Learning with TensorFlow
